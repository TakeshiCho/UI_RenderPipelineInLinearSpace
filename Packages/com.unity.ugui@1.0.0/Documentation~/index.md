# Unity UI: Unity User Interface

Unity UI is a UI toolkit for developing user interfaces for games and applications. It is a GameObject-based UI system that uses Components and the Game View to arrange, position, and style user interfaces.

You cannot use Unity UI to create or change user interfaces in the Unity Editor.

This documentation describes Unity UI features such as creating a Canvas, positioning and animating elements, defining user interactions, and sizing layouts automatically.
